Compare Holidays App

Summary:
This is a basic form based app written in pure JavaScript, which takes user input regarding different holidays and makes comparisons in several ways, such as price and weather. This app is
not intended for use by the public, but simply a training device to help me make comparisons in efficieny and method between using JS frameworks (e.g. JQuery) and vanilla JavaScript.


Status:

- The groundwork for the app has just begun and will be changed and added to significantly in the next few weeks.


Key Features:

- No Frameworks, just Vanilla JS.
- The Google Maps APi is used.
- An open weather APi is used. (*Not Yet Added) 

Files:

- The main files which are currentlty being worked on are found in the root (/index.html) and
within the js folder (js/scripts.js).  

- Please feel free to comment on my code if you have any helpful advice.
